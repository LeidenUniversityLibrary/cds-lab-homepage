title: The process of migration
---

This page describes the general process of moving data out of SharePoint
and into a data model and data format that can be used in different
contexts. In general, these converted data can be readily stored in a
data archive.

Contact the CDS for information.

# Data modelling

Unless you only used the VRE for sharing files that are read and edited
outside the VRE, you probably have information that is managed directly
in SharePoint. The data model explains what the information is about.

Some projects already started with a highly structured data model, other
projects need more help to reshape their data into models that are more
interoperable with existing datasets.

In many cases, we will meet several times
to discuss what your data describe and how data points are interrelated.

# Find models to map to

For your data to be understandable by other researchers (or anyone else,
really), it helps tremendously to use common data models. Many people
have already created data models to describe books, people, architecture
and art, et cetera. However, not everyone describes every item in the same
way, so you may need to extend or adapt an existing data model.

There are too many possible models to list here, so we only link to some
databases that provide overviews of existing models:

- [Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV)](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/) indexes ontologies and RDF Schemas
- [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) collects standards, databases and policies

# Iteratively create mapping(s) and test their correctness

# Perform the migration

# Archive the data

See the Research Data Services catalogue for information on data archives.
