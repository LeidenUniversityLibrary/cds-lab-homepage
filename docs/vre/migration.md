# Data modelling

In many cases, we will meet several times
to discuss what your data describe and how data points are interrelated.

Some projects already started with a highly structured data model, other
projects need more help to reshape their data into models that are more
interoperable with existing datasets.

# Find models to map to

# Iteratively create mapping(s) and test their correctness

# Perform the migration

# Archive the data
