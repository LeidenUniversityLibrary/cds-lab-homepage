# What is a Virtual Research Environment (VRE)?

See the [Libraries' website on VREs][vre] to learn more about VREs and what
Leiden University Libraries can do for you.

# Types of VREs

Below are a few VRE platforms, although many more are available. VRE systems are usually
tailored to tasks for specific research, although the generic ones below can be customised for
many fields.

## SharePoint

[Library-managed VREs][vre] are based on Microsoft SharePoint. They allow collaborating on
(office) documents, sharing files, and storing information in (a collection of interlinked)
lists, among other features. The lists functionality is like a database and can be accessed
from Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel.

## Omeka S

[Omeka S] is an open-source content management system for images and other content. It supports IIIF sources
and exports data about items as RDF. The CDS is currently testing Omeka S.

## Nodegoat

[Nodegoat] is an open-source online database system. The CDS does not currently use or support
Nodegoat, but it is on our radar.
The hosted service provided by the creators is free for individual researchers.

# Exporting data from a SharePoint VRE for archiving or publication

When a project ends, you usually stop using the virtual research environment
for working on the project data. That doesn't mean you don't need the data
anymore – that would be silly and probably not what you put in your data
management plan!

Your VRE will not be deleted without asking you first – and it is fine to keep
it around indefinitely. However, you may find that the VRE is not the best
way to make your data available to the wider world. You may therefore want to
export the data to a different platform for preservation and more ease of use.

The Centre for Digital Scholarship can help you export and convert the data so
that it is easier to archive in a Trustworthy Digital Repository or use in
offline analyses. Read [more about migrating data from VREs](migration.md).

For example, the CDS helped with [North-Korean posters](../projects/nk-posters.md).
