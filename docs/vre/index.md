See the [Libraries' website on VREs]() to learn more about VREs and what
Leiden University Libraries can do for you.

# Migrating from a SharePoint VRE

When a project ends, you usually stop using the virtual research environment
for working on the project data. That doesn't mean you don't need the data
anymore – that would be silly and probably not what you put in your data
management plan!

Your VRE will not be deleted without asking you first – and it is fine to keep
it around indefinitely. However, you may find that the VRE is not the best
way to make your data available to the wider world. You may therefore want to
export the data to a different platform for preservation and more ease of use.

The Centre for Digital Scholarship can help you export and convert the data so
that it is easier to archive in a Trustworthy Digital Repository or use in
offline analyses. Read [more about migrating data from VREs](migration.md).

For example, the CDS helped with [North-Korean posters](../projects/nk-posters.md).
