title: Persistent URLs
---

When you create a website for a project or dataset and you want to ensure
that the pages are accessible after the project ends or when the website
is moved to a different location, you can use *persistent URLs*.

The Centre for Digital Scholarship now supports the management of
persistent URLs for research projects. Read on for terms and conditions.

# What are persistent URLs?

Persistent URLs (PURLs for short) are long-lived URLs. They are not necessarily
*permanent*, but the people or organisation managing PURLs intend to keep
the content at the PURLs available for a long time.

When the project ends and the domain name and webspace is no longer payed for,
but you still want to have your website online, perhaps you can store a static
version on a more permanent university-offered server. By using the PURL service
to link to pages before you move, your links should keep working after the website
moves to the different domain.

# What is the Persistent URLs service?

The PURL service is available for the Leiden University research community to help
with setting up persistent URLs for a website.

This service is based on <https://w3id.org/> and is meant for fairly simple redirects.

# What conditions does my project need to meet?

The main consideration for the PURL service to work with your website is that the URLs
have a simple structure.

We cannot host your website, let alone re-engineer it for this to hold.
