title: Generic guidance for enrichment projects
---

This document can be used as a reference for (research) projects in which (digital) objects are collected, described, annotated and presented.
If you intend to perform these activities, you are reusing and creating data.
Especially when you data you want to use come from cultural heritage collections, we say you are *enriching* the objects.
Doing this properly can save you and others lots of effort and it will definitely make your research better.
It is not meant as a template for projects that you fill out like a form, but you can use it as inspiration for writing your project proposal.

For any questions, please get in touch with the Centre for Digital Scholarship.

## Goals of enrichment

As with any project, you should first understand the goals of the project. What questions are you trying to answer? How is enriching objects helping you answer your questions? Will you be working with a few example objects or are you trying to generalise by working with a large set of objects?

Who else might be interested in the results of your enrichment activities? What other projects have inspired you to try this?

## Sources: objects to enrich

What is your source material? Where will you get it? Who owns the rights to the source materials?

Objects may be textual, visual, audible or of a different nature. The type(s) of your source materials will influence the way you work with them, starting with how you retrieve them.

If the objects you want to collect and enrich are available online, published by trustworthy archives or libraries, accessible via persistent identifiers and stable and open protocols, there is no need to create copies on your own computer. Copying such objects may even make your research harder, as you have to pay for the extra storage, manage backups[^1], find a way to share 'your' copies with colleagues and make sure your enrichments can be linked to the originals.

[^1]: You should already have a way of managing backups of everything important on your computer. Ask your IT department for help with this.

It is a different story when the originals are not digitised, only available within the holding institution, or don't have persistent identifiers. Maybe for security or privacy you can only work with them offline, with strict access controls for everything related to the objects â€“ including enrichments. This will not be covered in this guide.

In some cases it is okay to create digital representations of objects yourself and use those in the project. Note that you may need approval from the owner or holding institute. Also, you will also need to describe the representations, keep links to the originals through identifiers and arrange for storage.
Creating representations of objects should be done in a very consistent manner, following best practices for the specific types of objects and the goals of the project.  

## Models for objects and enrichments

Depending on the type of objects you are using, different kinds of enrichments can be used. The way you refer to (fragments of) objects varies as well.
What are the parts to each of your objects? Files, metadata files, database rows?

What do you want to do with your objects? Add descriptions of the whole object, or parts of the object? Do you want to link to other objects in the same collection, or link to external objects or concepts?
