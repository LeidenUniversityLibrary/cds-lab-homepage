# Ethics and Terms of use

As a general note: please consider the ethics of using tweets, as well as Twitter's terms of use. Many Twitter users do not regard publishing tweets to include consenting to all forms of research. The University of Sheffield notes in <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.670954!/file/Research-Ethics-Policy-Note-14.pdf> that social media data is considered research on human subjects. For politicians there are probably other considerations to include.
Also, the free Twitter APIs do not provide access to all tweets, so the data set will not be a complete view of the 'Twittersphere'.
The blog post https://medium.com/on-archivy/twitters-developer-policies-for-researchers-archivists-and-librarians-63e9ba0433b2 discusses Twitter's August 2018 changes to their terms and conditions for research and archiving.

# Software

In terms of software: the SOLO department (solo@fsw.leidenuniv.nl) at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences has a bulk license for ATLAS.ti, which is used for discourse analysis and includes functionality to get data from Twitter. Other tools include text mining software like Orange 3 (https://orange.biolab.si/) with the text mining plugin or KNIME (https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform).
