title: Working with (digital) data
status: draft
---

Digital scholarship nearly always involves working with digital data.
Because *working with* is rather abstract, we often view data as artifacts that
you can *create*, *process*, *analyse*, *preserve*, *share* and *re-use*.
These activities can be viewed as a cycle, since re-using data can lead to
creating new data.
This cycle is sourced from the [UK Data Service][ukdsc].
There are various other cycles that are used to guide data management,
discussed by Alex Ball in [Review of Data Management Lifecycle Models (2012)][ball].

# Creating data

!!! tip "Collaborate on data with a VRE"
    Virtual Research Environments allow you to work together on a (data)
    project.
    See [VREs](../vre/index.md) for more information.

## "Collaborative data maintenance"

The [Collaborative Data Patterns](https://collaborative-data.theodi.org/)
website contains great explanations of things to think of when you work
together on a dataset.

# Processing data

# Analysing data

# Preserving data

# Giving access to data

The CDS promotes making your data [FAIR], especially when sharing it.
[Publishing your data](publishing-data/index.md) has more on making your data
available in FAIR ways.

!!! tip "Using Persistent URLs"
    See [Persistent URLs](../purl.md) for information about persistent URLs for
    your data.

# Re-using data

[Enriching resources](enriching-resources/index.md) is an excellent example of
re-using data.

To get data, you may get datasets from data archives, from APIs or perhaps even
by [scraping](reusing-data/web-scraping.md) them from webpages.
