**THIS PAGE IS A DRAFT**

Digital scholarship nearly always involves working with digital data.
Because *working with* is rather abstract, we often view data as artifacts that you can
*create*, *process*, *analyse*, *preserve*, *share* and *re-use*.
These activities can be viewed as a cycle, since re-using data can lead to creating new data.

# Creating data

!!! tip "Collaborate on data with a VRE"
    Virtual Research Environments allow you to work together on a (data) project.
    See [VREs](../vre/index.md) for more information.

# Processing data

# Analysing data

# Preserving data

# Giving access to data

!!! tip "Using Persistent URLs"
    See [Persistent URLs](../purl.md) for information about persistent URLs for your data.

# Re-using data

[Enriching resources](enriching-resources/index.md) is an excellent example of re-using data.
