title: Nanopublications
status: draft

[Nanopublications] are small units of publication, "implemented in" [RDF].
Each *nanopub* contains assertions, provenance and publication information.
Assertions are the core contributions of the publication.
Provenance links the contributions to methods, previous data and publications.
Publication information is the metadata of the nanopub: who are responsible
for it, when was it published?

Although nanopubs can be distributed as files, there is an elaborate system
of applications to help create nanopubs and server applications to publish
them.
