title: Welcome to the Centre for Digital Scholarship's Lab

This server hosts proofs of concept that the <a href="https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/cds" target="_blank">Centre for Digital Scholarship</a> (have) created in collaboration with researchers.

# Current projects

These are some example projects the CDS is working on.

## [Abnormal Hieratic Global Portal](abnormalhieratic/)

Community resource for studying Abnormal Hieratic manuscripts, developed in cooperation with the Faculty of Humanities.

## [Lydgate](lydgate/)

Online edition of Leiden University Libraries' edition of the Lydgate manuscript, edited by students.

## [Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom](digmanclass/)

Leiden University Libraries have a great collection of manuscripts,
but it is infeasible to use many of them for education, because they
are rare and often fragile. This platform is being developed to allow
online exploration of the manuscripts by theme.

## [FromThePage transcription platform](transcription/)

The CDS hosts a slightly modified version of the
[FromThePage platform](https://fromthepage.com). FromThePage is an
open-source server application that allows researchers and institutions
to let people help transcribe (and translate) works on a page-by-page basis.

FromThePage is used in various projects. The source code for our version
is openly available at GitHub: [bencomp/fromthepage](https://github.com/bencomp/fromthepage).

## [Iran Turan](https://iranturan.leiden.edu/)

The CDS set up Omeka Classic to support the [Turks, texts and territory project][iranproject].

## [Soldaat in IndonesiÃ«](https://indonesie.universiteitleiden.nl/start.php)

Online research environment for working with ego documents written by soldiers in Indonesia.

## Mirador demonstrations

Early demonstrations of IIIF using Mirador are hosted on [DigitalScholarship.nl](https://digitalscholarship.nl/view/).

## UBL maps in Geoplaza

Leiden University Libraries have collaborated with the Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam to show [51 maps from our collections in the Geoplaza portal][ublgeoplaza].
