# Current projects

These are some example projects the CDS is working on.

## [Abnormal Hieratic](abnormalhieratic/)

Community resource for studying Abnormal Hieratic manuscripts, developed in cooperation with the Faculty of Humanities.

## [Lydgate](lydgate/)

Online edition of Leiden University Libraries' edition of the Lydgate manuscript, edited by students.

## [FromThePage transcription platform](transcription/)

The CDS hosts a slightly modified version of the [FromThePage platform](https://fromthepage.com). FromThePage is an open-source server application that allows researchers and archives to let people help transcribe (and translate) works on a page-by-page basis.

FromThePage is used in various projects. The source code for our version is openly available at GitHub: [bencomp/fromthepage](https://github.com/bencomp/fromthepage).
