# Welcome to the Centre for Digital Scholarship's Lab

This server hosts proofs of concept that the <a href="https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/research-and-publishing/centre-for-digital-scholarship" target="_blank">Centre for Digital Scholarship</a> (have) created in collaboration with researchers.

# Current projects

These are some example projects the CDS is working on.

## [Abnormal Hieratic](abnormalhieratic/)

Community resource for studying Abnormal Hieratic manuscripts, developed in cooperation with the Faculty of Humanities.

## [Lydgate](lydgate/)

Online edition of Leiden University Libraries' edition of the Lydgate manuscript, edited by students.

## [Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom](digmanclass/)

Leiden University Libraries have a great collection of manuscripts, but it is infeasible to use many of them for education, because they are rare and often fragile. This platform is being developed to allow online exploration of the manuscripts by theme.

## [FromThePage transcription platform](transcription/)

The CDS hosts a slightly modified version of the [FromThePage platform](https://fromthepage.com). FromThePage is an open-source server application that allows researchers and institutions to let people help transcribe (and translate) works on a page-by-page basis.

FromThePage is used in various projects. The source code for our version is openly available at GitHub: [bencomp/fromthepage](https://github.com/bencomp/fromthepage).

## Mirador demonstrations

Early demonstrations of IIIF using Mirador are hosted on [DigitalScholarship.nl](https://digitalscholarship.nl/view/).

## UBL maps in Geoplaza

Leiden University Libraries have collaborated with the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam to show [51 maps from our collections in the Geoplaza portal](https://geoplaza.labs.vu.nl/catalog?f%5bdct_provenance_s%5d%5b%5d=Universitaire+Bibliotheken+Leiden).
