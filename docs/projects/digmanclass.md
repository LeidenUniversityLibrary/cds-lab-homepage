title: Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom
---

Digital Manuscripts in the Classroom is an Open Educational Resource teaching
students about manuscripts using digitised items from the special collections
at Leiden University Libraries. The availability of these items via [IIIF]
allows easy integration of a deep-zoom viewer in the website.

The website is created using the [Jekyll] static site generator.
